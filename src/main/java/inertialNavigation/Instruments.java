	 * these are Tait-Bryan angles, commonly used in aircraft orientation.
	 * In this coordinate system, the positive z-axis is down toward Earth.
	 * Yaw is the angle between SensorPackage x-axis and Earth magnetic North (or true North if corrected for local declination,
	 * looking down on the sensor positive yaw is counterclockwise.
	 * Pitch is angle between sensor x-axis and Earth ground plane, toward the Earth is positive, up toward the sky is negative.
	 * Roll is angle between sensor y-axis and Earth ground plane, y-axis up is positive roll.
	 * <p>
	 * These arise from the definition of the homogeneous rotation matrix constructed from quaternions.
	 * Tait-Bryan angles as well as Euler angles are non-commutative; that is, the get the correct orientation the rotations must be
	 * applied in the correct order which for this configuration is yaw, pitch, and then roll.
